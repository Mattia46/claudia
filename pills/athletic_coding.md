Athletic Coding
==============

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Athletic Coding is a term coined by Professor Philip Johnson of University of Hawaii.  The idea is not unlike that of code kata, but with an explicit focus on increasing the speed with which the kata can be completed, and also a video walkthrough of the solution, so that students who are failing to complete the task within a specific time, can watch the walkthrough and then re-attempt.

Athletic Pairing
--------

The idea can be extended to an athletic pairing using a pairing protocol such as ping-pong or change-the-message, so that a a pair of students can work to increase the speed with which they can complete a pairing kata.
