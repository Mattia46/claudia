# Final Project Presentations

Here are some guidelines for your final project presentations:

* The time limit is usually 5 minutes (this depends on the number of projects, your coach will advise if the time limit is different).  Practice, practice, practice to ensure you come in under the time limit.  You'll be cut off at 5 minutes!

* To guide you on what to include, think what you found interesting about other peopleâ€™s presentations.

* If appropriate, make it funny. If not, make it engaging.

* Explain very briefly a scenario where someone might use your project. What problem does it solve?

* Make a video that demonstrates a user using your project.  One of your team can describe what's going on as the video plays.  No need for a live demo (every time I've done a live demo, at least one thing has gone wrong). You can use [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/kb/ph5882?locale=en_US) (built-in to MacOS) to record your screen.

* If appropriate, pick an interesting technical aspect of your project to explain to the audience. You might want to use a code snippet of which you're particularly proud to help you (or some other visual aid).

* Describe the architecture of your project.  Make sure a non-technical audience will be able to understand your description.  Don't put up the _Wall of Death_ (the slide that is just library and framework logos).  Instead, perhaps describe how information flows through your architecture. Start from a user interaction and show where information is sent.

* Describe any interesting struggles you had with teamwork, learning or programming.  Describe how you overcame them.  Focus on behaviours and skills.  Be specific.  Don't say, "we communicated well".  Say, "We had a miscommunication where two pairs worked on the same feature.  We decided in the future to..."

* There's no need to talk about the future direction of the project.  Focus your presentation on what you've already achieved.
