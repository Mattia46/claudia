**Crucial Omissions:** There are some cross-cutting strands that we fit in alongside other work. These include careers and code quality. They are not the topic of any one week, and you will miss them out unless you think of them regularly!

## Week 1

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### Challenges

* [Afternoons - Boris bikes](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/dearshrewdwit/projects/1418)
* [Weekend - Airport](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/neoeno/projects/33)

### Practicals

These can be used by the devs independently, or enhanced by a coach delivering and offering structured process, group discussion, feedback, etc.

* [Test Driving](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/dearshrewdwit/projects/908)
* [Debugging Approaches](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/dearshrewdwit/projects/832)

## Week 2

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

Some developers may notice they are completing the work easier than their peers and ease off the effort here. They should be identified and pushed to have their code reviewed to a professional standard to make best use of the time available.

## Week 6

By the end of the week all developers will have had a [mini viva](./pills/W6_viva.md) with a coach and received feedback on their learning progress.

By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

* Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
* Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
* Run stand-ups and retrospectives
* Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
* Give and receive meaningful code review

### Challenges

* [Weekdays - MakersBnB](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/neoeno/projects/34)
* [Weekend - Bowling again](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/neoeno/projects/32)


## Week 7

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Build a front-end app in Javascript
* Work competently in Javascript *
* Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

\* This week is analogous to week 2 in that developers will be wrestling with some underlying language concepts that are not well understood (by Makers).

Most of the work and interventions we have run historically are meant to 'de-magic' Javascript and force developers to confront the pieces they are glossing over in an attempt to get work done.

### Challenges

Note: they get the choice of morning goals / afternoon challenges vs all day project groups.

* [Afternoons - Notes app](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/further_javascript)
* Weekend, either of:
