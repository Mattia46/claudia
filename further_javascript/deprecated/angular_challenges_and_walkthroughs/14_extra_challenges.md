## Extra Challenges

If you want to keep going and add some more features to your app, here's some extra user stories you can use to add more functionality to your app:

```
As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```

## Further extensions

* Deploy the app to Heroku
* Create a persistence layer (e.g. MongoDB), or use LocalStorage or the filesystem through Node
* Make it look purdy (CSS) - try a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation
