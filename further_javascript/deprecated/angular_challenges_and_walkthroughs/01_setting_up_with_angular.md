# Setting up with Angular

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

Angular runs entirely on the Client. That means that you don't need a Server to run, load, or deploy an Angular app. A **server-less** website is usually called a **static** website.

In this challenge, you will create a **static** webpage and set up an **Angular application** within that static site.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Set up a static website.
- Set up an Angular app.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Create an `index.html` file containing the minimal HTML structure.
- [ ] Open and view the file in a web browser.
- [ ] Download Angular 1.5.x from the [Angular website](https://angularjs.org/) and include the script in the `<head>` of your `index.html`.
- [ ] Use the first guide on the [Angular website](https://angularjs.org/) ('The Basics') to set up a basic Angular application.
