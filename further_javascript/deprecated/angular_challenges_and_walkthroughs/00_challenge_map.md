# Intro to Frontend Frameworks

This week is designed to introduce you to Frontend Frameworks. You've recently met Rails, a Model-View-Controller framework for constructing 'full-stack' web applications. Rails is designed to be most useful as a 'Backend' framework: that is, most (if not all) of the logic and processing in Rails is handled on the Server. This week, we'll introduce a framework which is designed to do more logic and processing on the Client.

Here are some benefits to pushing application logic on to the Client:

- Lower server costs because processing is more 'distributed'
- Faster response times because data is processed locally, not via request-response
- Simpler - or even 'server-less' - deploy strategies.

We'll be looking at Google's popular frontend framework, Angular. Angular does not follow the string MVC pattern you know from Rails, but it does _Separate Concerns_ along similar lines. As you build applications this week, try to map your understanding of how Rails' structure fits together onto Angular.

This week, you will:

- 'Spike' a basic Angular app without tests, so you can understand how Angular fits together (1 Day)
- Test-Drive that same Angular app, so you can understand how Angular handles feature and unit testing (1 Day)
- Spike and Test Drive a more complex Angular project (2 Days).

Your aim for this week is to answer 'yes' with some confidence to the following question: *Can I build a frontend application?*
