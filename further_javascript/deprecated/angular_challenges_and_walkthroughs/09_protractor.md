# Setting up and running protractor

[Back to the Challenge Map](00_challenge_map.md)

To start testing you're going to need to do a bit more setup. First of all we're
going to use [protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) for running
our feature tests (called end-to-end tests by Angular). Protractor is a bit like
capybara, but it uses a programme called Selenium to open up an actual browser
and run your tests in that.

Don't forget to do this challenge test-first!

### Learning Objectives covered
- Install protractor
- Run Angular using `http-server`
- Running Angular feature tests using Protractor
