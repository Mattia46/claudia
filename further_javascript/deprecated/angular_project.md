# Angular Project

This week's project is to create a simple GitHub Profile app purely in JavaScript that grabs data from the Github API in order to display a specified user's avatar, number of followers and number of repos.

We'll present these projects on Monday.

The project will involve using JavaScript to consume data available from third parties over the network (e.g. GitHub API data accessed via Ajax) and using more advanced JavaScript Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks such as AngularJS.

The project will need to be deployed to Heroku, and the choice of back-end server is up to you: Node for the brave, Ruby for the stable. If you're feeling really clever, try to deploy using a static site generator, such as Middleman (on Github Pages).
