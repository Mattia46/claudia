# Angular Week: Getting to grips with Angular

These are the basic nuts and bolts of Angular. Make sure you can answer these questions relatively well before you start the Project later this week. **Actually ask them to your pair: repetition and drilling is encouraged.**

Targeted resources are provided for most questions: we think these are the best way to answer them, but if you find better ones then follow your learning nose. **The best way to figure out the answers, as always, is by playing with the code you're building.** If we haven't provided resources, it's because the answer is clear from the tutorial.

Each question topic is targeted to a section of the [Phonecat tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) **(given in parentheses)**. Don't spend too long diving in to any one question - you're getting an overview here!

### 1. MV* JavaScript (Before starting)
- Why would you want a JavaScript framework?
- Angular is often called an 'Model-View-Whatever' framework. What is that?
